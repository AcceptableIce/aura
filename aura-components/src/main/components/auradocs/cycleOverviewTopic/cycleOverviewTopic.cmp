<aura:component extends="auradocs:topicPanel">
    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Component Request Lifecycle"/>

    <p>This section shows how Aura handles a component request. You can use Aura without knowing these details but read on if you are curious about how things work under the covers.</p>

    <p>We saw in an earlier topic how Aura processes an <auradocs:topicLink topic="faqInit">initial request for an app</auradocs:topicLink>.</p>

    <p>When a component is requested, Aura retrieves the relevant metadata and data to construct the component from the server. The framework uses the metadata and data to construct the component on the client, enabling the client to render the component.</p>
