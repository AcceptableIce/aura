    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Testing Components"/>

    <p>Aura's loosely coupled components facilitate maintainability, enable efficient testing,
    and isolate each component from their application context for easier testing.
    Aura supports JavaScript testing for components and applications in production mode when you develop using
    the framework.</p>

    <h2>Setting Up Your Tests</h2>

    <p>Add component tests to a JavaScript file in the component bundle. For example, a component <code>inputAddr.cmp</code> in the ui namespace is saved in the folder inputPhone, which
    can contain a test file <code>inputAddrTest.js</code>. Add a test case as a new function in the component's test file. See <auradocs:topicLink topic="compBundle">Component Bundles</auradocs:topicLink> for more information.
    </p>

    <p>Note that your test functions must follow the naming convention <code>test&lt;testName&gt;</code>.
    Individual test cases can share code by putting them in a shared function in the format <code>this.sharedMethod()</code>.
    The functions <code>setUp</code> and <code>tearDown</code> are optional and let you quickly set up and remove objects.
    They are called before and after a test method is run.
    </p>

    <auradocs:info> Aura's unit testing framework can be viewed on <a href="https://github.com/forcedotcom/lumen-beta/blob/master/aura-impl/src/main/resources/aura/test/Test.js" target="_blank">github</a>. Make sure you have access to the Aura repo.</auradocs:info>
    <p>You may want to use <auradocs:topicLink topic="testAssert">assertions</auradocs:topicLink>, <auradocs:topicLink topic="testsUser">user interactions</auradocs:topicLink>, and <auradocs:topicLink topic="testsUtility">utility functions</auradocs:topicLink> available to you for unit testing.</p>


    <h2>The Test Environment</h2>
    <p>You can run JavaScript tests in a Web browser by appending <code>?aura.mode=JSTEST</code> to your production component.
    For example, if you have a component <code>inputAddr.cmp</code> in the ui namespace, you can run test cases on <code>
    http://&lt;your server&gt;/ui/inputAddr.cmp?aura.mode=JSTEST</code> and the test results are displayed in the same tab on the browser.</p>

    <h2>Debugging Components</h2>
    <h3>Tools</h3>
    <p>Use the <code>debugger;</code> statement to debug your JavaScript test. You can view your debug output by appending
    <code>?aura.mode=JSTESTDEBUG</code> to your production component. Remove or comment out the <code>debugger</code> statement after you finish debugging.</p>
    <p>Another useful tool for debugging is Google Chrome's Developer Tools.
            <ul>
                <li>To open Developer Tools on Windows and Linux, press Control - Shift - I in your Chrome browser.</li>
                <li>To quickly find which line of code a test fails on, enable the <b>Pause on all exceptions</b> option before running the test.</li>
             </ul>
             Learn more about how to use  breakpoints at <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/scripts-breakpoints" target="_blank">Chrome Developer Tools</a>.</p>

    <h3>Writing Asserts</h3>
    <p>Include unique and specific error messages in your assert statements. For example, use <code>assertTrue(run, "Returns true if the action has run successfully.")</code>
    instead of a generic message. Making each assert message unique also helps in narrowing down which assert statement has failed. </p>
