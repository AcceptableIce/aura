    <p>Components are the self-contained and reusable units of an Aura app.
    They represent a reusable section of the UI, and can range in granularity from a single line of text to an entire app.
    Components are rendered to produce HTML DOM elements within the browser.
    The framework includes a rich set of prebuilt components.
    You can assemble and configure components to form new components in an app.</p>

    <p>A component can contain other components, as well as HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, or any other Web-enabled code.
    This enables you to build apps  with sophisticated UIs.
    Component files contain the markup used to build that UI and have a .cmp suffix.
    The markup can contain text or references to other components, and also declares metadata about the component.
    Components that contain data models are initialized on the server.</p>

    <p>The details of a component's implementation are encapsulated.
    This allows the consumer of a component to focus on building their app,
    while the component author can innovate and make changes without breaking consumers.
    You configure components by setting the named attributes that they expose in their definition.
    Components interact with their environment by listening to or publishing events.</p>
