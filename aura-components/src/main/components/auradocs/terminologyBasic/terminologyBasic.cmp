                         A large part of Aura is a registry of definitions for its various elements.
                        <p>A definition's metadata can include a name, location of origin, and descriptor (DefDescriptor, the primary key of the definition).
                        </p>

                    <td>DefDescriptor</td>
                    <td>A DefDescriptor acts as a key for a definition in a registry. It's an Aura class that contains the metadata for any definition used in Aura, such as a component, action, or event.
                         In the example of a model, it is a nicely parsed description of <code>model="java://myPackage.MyClass"</code> with methods to retrieve the language, class name, and package name.

                         Rather than passing a more heavyweight definition around in code, Aura usually passes around a DefDescriptor instead.
                         <p>The qualified name for a DefDescriptor has the format <code>prefix://namespace:name</code>.
                            <ul>
                                <li>prefix: Defines the language, such as JavaScript or Java</li>
                                <li>namespace: Corresponds to the package name or XML namespace</li>
                                <li>name: Corresponds to the class name or local name</li>
                            </ul>

                    <td>Registry</td>
                    <td>Registries store metadata definitions. Some registries last for the duration of a request, while others are cached for the lifetime of an app.
                    They may be created during the request process and destroyed when the server completes the request. A master definition registry contains a list of registries for each Aura element.</td>
