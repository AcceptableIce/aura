<p>Use Java for server-side Aura code.</p>

<p>Services are the API in front of Aura. The Aura class is the entry point in Java for accessing server-side services.</p>

<p>Your app can contain the following types of Java files.</p>

<ul>
    <li><auradocs:topicLink topic="models">Models</auradocs:topicLink> for initializing component data</li>
    <li><auradocs:topicLink topic="serverSideControllers">Server-side controllers</auradocs:topicLink> for handling requests from client-side controllers</li>
    <li><auradocs:topicLink topic="oodProviders">Server-Side Providers</auradocs:topicLink> for returning a concrete component at runtime for an abstract component or an interface in markup</li>
    <li><auradocs:topicLink topic="securityProviders">Security Providers</auradocs:topicLink> for centralized security logic to control access to your app</li>
</ul>

<p>The <auradocs:topicLink topic="javaCookbook">Java cookbook</auradocs:topicLink> includes more granular code snippets and samples that could be used in different types of Java files.</p>
