  <aura:set attribute="title" value="Server-Side Controllers"/>

  <p>You can use client-side and server-side controllers in Aura. An event is always wired to a client-side controller action, which can in turn call a server-side controller action. For example, a client-side controller might handle an event and call a server-side controller action to persist data to a database.</p>

  <p>You can create a server-side controller in Java. All methods on server-side controllers must be static since Aura doesn’t create a controller instance per component instance. Instead, all instances of a given component share one static controller. This means that any state stored on the controller is shared across all instances of a component definition. This is unlikely to be what you want.</p>

  <p>In contrast, one model instance is created for each component instance. This means that models are the appropriate place to store state that is specific to one instance of a component.</p>

  <p>This diagram shows the flow from browser to client-side controller to server-side controller.</p>

    <p><ui:image src="/auraFW/resources/aura/images/serverSideActions.png" alt="Server-Side Controller Action Call Flow" /></p>

  <p>The <code>press</code> attribute wires the button to the <code>handlePress</code> action of the client-side controller by using <code>c.handlePress</code>. The client-side action name must match everything after the <code>c.</code></p>

  <p>In the client-side controller, we again use the value provider of <code>c</code> to invoke a server-side controller action. The <code>cmp.get("c.doSomething")</code> call indicates that we are calling the <code>doSomething</code> method in the server-side controller. The method name in the server-side controller must match everything after the <code>c.</code> in the client-side call.</p>

  <h2>Calling a Server-Side Action</h2>

  <p>You can only call a server-side controller from a client-side controller. In the client-side controller, you set a callback, which is called after the server-side action is completed. A server-side action can return any object containing serializable JSON data.</p>

  <p>A client-side controller is a JSON object containing name-value pairs. Each name corresponds to a client-side action. Its value is the JavaScript function associated with the action.</p>

  <p>The following client-side controller includes an <code>echo</code> action that executes a <code>serverEcho</code> action on a server-side controller. The client-side controller sets a callback action that is invoked after the server-side action returns. In this case, the callback function alerts the user with the value returned from the server. The sample code demonstrates the steps to invoke a simple server-side action.</p>

<auradocs:codeblock>
{
    "echo" : function(component) {
        // create a one-time use instance of the serverEcho action
        // in the server-side controller
        var a = component.get("c.serverEcho");
        a.setParams({ firstName : component.get("v.firstName") });

        // Create a callback that is executed after the server-side action returns
        a.setCallback(this, function(action) {
            if (action.getState() === "ERROR") {
                alert("Server Error: " + action.getError()[0].message));
            }
            else {
              // Alert the user with the value returned from the server
              alert("From server: " + action.getReturnValue());

              // You would typically fire a event here to trigger client-side
              // notification that the server-side action is complete
            }
        });

        // A client-side action could cause multiple events, which could trigger
        // other events and other server-side action calls.
        // $A.enqueueAction adds the server-side action to the queue.
        // Rather than send a separate request for each individual action,
        // Aura processes the event chain and
        // executes the action in the queue after batching up related requests.
        $A.enqueueAction(a);
    }
}

    <h2>Wiring Up a Server-Side Controller</h2>
    
    <p>The component must include a controller attribute that wires it to the server-side Java controller. For example:</p>

<auradocs:codeblock>
  <![CDATA[<aura:component controller="java://org.auraframework.demo.controllers.TrivialServerSideController">]]>
</auradocs:codeblock>

  <h2>Java Controller</h2>

  <p>This Java controller contains a <code>serverEcho</code> action that simply prepends a string to the value passed in. This is a simple example that allows us to verify in the client that the value was returned by the server.</p>

<auradocs:codeblock>
  package org.auraframework.demo.controllers;

  @Controller
  public class TrivialServerSideController {

      //Use @AuraEnabled to enable client- and server-side access to the method
      @AuraEnabled
      public static String serverEcho(@Key("firstName")String firstName) {
          return ("From server: " + firstName);
      }
  }
</auradocs:codeblock>

  <h3>Java Annotations</h3>

  <p>These annotations are available in server-side controllers.</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Annotation</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>@Controller</code></td>
        <td>Denotes that a Java class is a server-side controller.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>@AuraEnabled</code></td>
        <td>Enables client- and server-side access to a controller method. This means that you only expose data that you have explicitly annotated. Other methods are not available.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>@Key</code></td>
        <td>Sets a key for each argument in a method for a server-side action. When you use <code>setParams</code> to set parameters in the client-side controller, match the JSON element name with the identifier for the <code>@Key</code> annotation. Note that we used <code>a.setParams({ firstName : component.get("v.firstName") });</code> in the client-side controller that calls our sample server-side controller.

        <p>The <code>@Key</code> annotation means that you don’t have to create an overloaded version of the method if you want to call it with different numbers of arguments. Aura simply passes in <code>null</code> for any unspecified arguments.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
