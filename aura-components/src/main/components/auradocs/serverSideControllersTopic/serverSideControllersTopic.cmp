  <aura:set attribute="title" value="Server-Side Controllers"/>

  <p>You can use client-side and server-side controllers in Aura. An event is always wired to a client-side controller action, which can in turn call a server-side controller action. For example, a client-side controller might handle an event and call a server-side controller action to persist data to a database. For an in-depth example of a server-side controller that interacts with a database, see the <code>NoteViewController</code> class in the Aura Note sample app.</p>

  <p>Server-side actions need to make a round trip, from the client to the server and back again, so they are usually completed more slowly than client-side actions. Use <code>$A.enqueueAction(action)</code> to add client-side or server-side controller actions to the queue of actions to be executed. All actions that are enqueued this way will be run at the end of the event loop. The actions are asynchronous and have callbacks. The <code>run</code> and <code>runAfter</code> methods are deprecated.</p>

  <p>You can create a server-side controller in Java. All methods on server-side controllers must be static because Aura doesn’t create a controller instance per component instance. Instead, all instances of a given component share one static controller. This means that any state stored on the controller is shared across all instances of a component definition. This is unlikely to be what you want.</p>

  <p>In contrast, one model instance is created for each component instance. This means that models are the appropriate place to store state that is specific to one instance of a component.</p>

  <p>This diagram shows the flow from browser to client-side controller to server-side controller.</p>

    <p><ui:image src="/auraFW/resources/aura/images/serverSideActions.png" alt="Server-Side Controller Action Call Flow" /></p>

  <p>The <code>press</code> attribute wires the button to the <code>handlePress</code> action of the client-side controller by using <code>c.handlePress</code>. The client-side action name must match everything after the <code>c.</code></p>

  <p>In the client-side controller, we again use the value provider of <code>c</code> to invoke a server-side controller action. The <code>cmp.get("c.doSomething")</code> call indicates that we are calling the <code>doSomething</code> method in the server-side controller. The method name in the server-side controller must match everything after the <code>c.</code> in the client-side call.</p>
  
  <p>The action queue contains both client-side and server-side actions.</p> 

  <h2>Calling a Server-Side Action</h2>

  <p>You can only call a server-side controller from a client-side controller. In the client-side controller, you set a callback, which is called after the server-side action is completed. A server-side action can return any object containing serializable JSON data.</p>

  <p>A client-side controller is a JSON object containing name-value pairs. Each name corresponds to a client-side action. Its value is the JavaScript function associated with the action.</p>

  <p>The following client-side controller includes an <code>echo</code> action that executes a <code>serverEcho</code> action on a server-side controller. The client-side controller sets a callback action that is invoked after the server-side action returns. In this case, the callback function alerts the user with the value returned from the server. The sample code demonstrates the steps to invoke a simple server-side action.</p>

<auradocs:codeblock>
{
    "echo" : function(component) {
        // create a one-time use instance of the serverEcho action
        // in the server-side controller
        var a = component.get("c.serverEcho");
        a.setParams({ firstName : component.get("v.firstName") });

        // Create a callback that is executed after the server-side action returns
        a.setCallback(this, function(action) {
            if (action.getState() === "ERROR") {
                alert("Server Error: " + action.getError()[0].message);
            }
            else {
              // Alert the user with the value returned from the server
              alert("From server: " + action.getReturnValue());

              // You would typically fire a event here to trigger client-side
              // notification that the server-side action is complete
            }
        });

        // A client-side action could cause multiple events, which could trigger
        // other events and other server-side action calls.
        // $A.enqueueAction adds the server-side action to the queue.
        // Rather than send a separate request for each individual action,
        // Aura processes the event chain and
        // executes the action in the queue after batching up related requests.
        $A.enqueueAction(a);
    }
}

    <h2>Wiring Up a Server-Side Controller</h2>
    
    <p>The component must include a controller attribute that wires it to the server-side Java controller. For example:</p>

<auradocs:codeblock>
  <![CDATA[<aura:component controller="java://org.auraframework.demo.controllers.TrivialServerSideController">]]>
</auradocs:codeblock>

  <h2>Java Controller</h2>

  <p>This Java controller contains a <code>serverEcho</code> action that simply prepends a string to the value passed in. This is a simple example that allows us to verify in the client that the value was returned by the server.</p>

<auradocs:codeblock>
  package org.auraframework.demo.controllers;

  @Controller
  public class TrivialServerSideController {

      //Use @AuraEnabled to enable client- and server-side access to the method
      @AuraEnabled
      public static String serverEcho(@Key("firstName")String firstName) {
          return ("From server: " + firstName);
      }
  }
</auradocs:codeblock>

  <h3>Java Annotations</h3>

  <p>These Java annotations are available in server-side controllers.</p>

  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Annotation</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>@Controller</code></td>
        <td>Denotes that a Java class is a server-side controller.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>@AuraEnabled</code></td>
        <td>Enables client- and server-side access to a controller method. This means that you only expose data that you have explicitly annotated. Other methods are not available.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><code>@Key</code></td>
        <td>Sets a key for each argument in a method for a server-side action. When you use <code>setParams</code> to set parameters in the client-side controller, match the JSON element name with the identifier for the <code>@Key</code> annotation. Note that we used <code>a.setParams({ firstName : component.get("v.firstName") });</code> in the client-side controller that calls our sample server-side controller.

        <p>The <code>@Key</code> annotation means that you don’t have to create an overloaded version of the method if you want to call it with different numbers of arguments. Aura simply passes in <code>null</code> for any unspecified arguments.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>@BackgroundAction</code></td>
        <td>Marks the action as a background action.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h2>Background Actions</h2>
  
  <p>An action can be marked as a background action. This can improve performance when using low priority, long-running actions such as those that access another web service. Each background action is sent in its own request so each request is responded to immediately after that particular action is finished. When the server-side actions in the queue are executed, the foreground actions are executed first and then the background actions are executed. Background actions run in parallel with foreground actions. Aura throttles foreground and background actions separately. This means that the number of long-running background server-side actions running at a time can be controlled. Throttling is done automatically, it is not user controlled. Even with seperate throttling, background actions might affect performance in some conditions such as if the browser is doing many fetches from servers.</p>

  <p>To set an action as a background action, get an instance of that action object in JavaScript and call the <code>setBackground()</code> method. Alternatively, <code>$A.enqueueAction()</code> has a parameter that can be used to set an action to be a background action. If that parameter is supplied and it is true, the action will be set as background when it is enqueued and you don’t need to also call the <code>setBackground()</code> method on the action. To mark a server-side action as a background action in Java, use the <code>@BackgroundAction</code> annotation at the method level on the controller. When an action is instantiated from an <code>actiondef</code>, the action’s <code>isBackground</code> property is set to true automatically.</p>

  <p>When <code>isBackground</code> is set to true for an action, the action can not be set back to a foreground action. In other words, calling <code>setBackground</code> to set it to false will have no effect.</p>
