    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Firing Aura Events from Non-Aura Code"/>

    <p>You can fire an Aura event from JavaScript code outside an Aura app. For example, your Aura app might need to call out to some non-Aura code, and then have that code communicate back to the Aura code once it's done.<p>

    <p>For example, you could call external code that needs to log into another system and return some data to your Aura app.
    To do this, add a new event. Let's call it,<code>mynamespace:​external​Event</code>. You'll fire this event when your non-Aura code is done by including this JavaScript in your non-Aura code.</p>

<auradocs:codeblock>
var myExternal​Event;
    if(window.​opener.$A && (​myExternal​Event = window.​opener.$A.​get("e.​mynamespace:​external​Event"))) {
        myExternal​Event.​setParams({​isOauthed: true});
         myExternal​Event.fire();​
    }
</auradocs:codeblock>
