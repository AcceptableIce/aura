    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Theming Apps"/>
		<p>Themes enable you to apply a consistent style across your apps. Each theme file contains attributes that define style names and default values.
		 You can then use theme functions, which are lookups to those attributes, in your component's CSS files within the same namespace or across namespaces. If you want to change the look and feel of components, change the theme values and the changes propagate to all the components that use the theme to ensure consistency in an app.
		 A theme can extend another theme if you want to reuse and tweak an existing theme.</p>
