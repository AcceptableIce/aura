    <p>Use the <code>&lt;aura:set&gt;</code> system tag to set the value of an attribute in a super component or an attribute on a component reference. When you include another component, such as <code>&lt;ui:button&gt;</code>, in a component, we call that a component reference to <code>&lt;ui:button&gt;</code>.</p>
