    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Client-Side Process"/>
    <p>In <auradocs:topicLink topic="cycleInit">Server-Side Process</auradocs:topicLink>, we looked at what happens on the server when the client sends a request for a component. After the server processes the request, it returns the component definitions (metadata for the all required components) and instance tree (data) in JSON format.</p>

    <p>The client performs these tasks:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Deserializes the response to create a metadata tree</li>
        <li>Traverses the metadata tree to create an instance tree</li>
        <li>Traverses the instance tree to render the component</li>
        <li>Renders the components</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>1. Deserialize the response to create a metadata tree</h4>
    <p>The JSON representation of the component definition is deserialized to create a metadata structure (JavaScript objects or maps).</p>

    <h4>2. Traverse the metadata tree to create an instance tree</h4>
    <p>The client traverses the JavaScript tree to initialize objects from the deserialized tree.
    The tree may contain:
    <ul>
        <li>Definition: The client initializes the definition.</li>
        <li>Descriptor only: The client knows that definition has been pre-loaded and cached.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>3. Traverse the instance tree to render the component</h4>
    <p>The client traverses the instance tree to render the component instance. The reference IDs are used to recreate the component references, which can point to a <code>ComponentDef</code>, a model, or a controller.</p>

    <h4>4. Render the components</h4>
    <p>The client locates the renderer definition in the component bundle, or uses the default renderer method to render the component and any sub-components.</p>
