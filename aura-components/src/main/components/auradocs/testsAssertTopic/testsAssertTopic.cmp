<aura:component extends="auradocs:topicPanel">
    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Assertions"/>

    <p>Assertions evaluates an object or expression for expected results and are the foundation of Aura Component testing.
    Each JavaScript test can contain one or more assertions. The test passes only when all the assertions are successful.
    Assertions should be prefixed with <code>aura.test</code> or <code>$A.test</code>. Aura supports these assertions.</p>
