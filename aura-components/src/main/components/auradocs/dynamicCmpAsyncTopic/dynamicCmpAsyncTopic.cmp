    <aura:set attribute="title" value="Dynamically Creating Components (Asynchronous)"/>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>You want to create a component dynamically from your client-side controller action or helper. </p>
    <auradocs:info>The following code uses the <code>newComponentAsync()</code> method, which replaces <code>newComponent()</code> and <code>newComponentDeprecated()</code>. </auradocs:info>
    
    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>This sample code creates a new <code>ui:button</code> component and appends it to the body.</p>
    <auradocs:codeblock>
    createButton : function(cmp) {
    $A.componentService.newComponentAsync(
            this,
            function(newcmp){
            	cmp.getValue("v.body").push(newcmp);
            },
            {
                "componentDef": "markup://ui:button",
                "attributes": {
                    "values": { label: "Submit" }
            }
        });
    }
    </auradocs:codeblock>
    <p><code>$A.componentService.newComponentAsync()</code> is equivalent to <code>$A.newCmpAsync()</code>. This method supports both client-side and server-side component creation.
    If no server-side dependencies are found, this method is run synchronously.</p>
    <p><code>$A.componentService.newComponentAsync()</code> takes in a callback scope, denoted by <code>this</code>. 
    It also takes in a required <code>callback</code> function that returns your newly created component, and a required <code>config</code> object, which provides the component descriptor and attributes.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>Server-side dependencies include server-side models, renderers, or providers for the component and its super components.
    A component with server-side dependencies will be created on the server, even if it's preloaded.
    If there are no server dependencies and the definition already exists on the client via preloading or declared dependencies, no server call is made.</p>
    <p>	
    If a component has server-side dependencies, Aura makes a server call even though it has a cached definition of the component.
    </p>
    <p>If a component has both a server-side and client-side renderer or provider, the client-side renderer or provider is used.
    </p>
    <auradocs:info>Creating components where the top-level components don't have server dependencies but nested inner components do is not currently supported.</auradocs:info>
