		<p>
			A <code>ui:button</code> component represents a button element that executes an action defined by a controller. Clicking the button triggers the client-side controller method set for the <code>press</code> event.
			The button can be created in several ways.
		</p>
		<p>
			A text-only button has only the required <code>label</code> attribute set on it. 
			To create a button with both image and text, use the <code>label</code> attribute and add styles for the button.
		</p>
		<p>
			The visual appearance of buttons is highly configurable, as are text and accessibility attributes.
