		<p>A <code>ui:pillContainerAutoComplete</code> component is nested in <code>ui:pillContainer</code> to create pills that work with autocompletion.
		When users type in the input field, a list of suggested values is displayed. Selecting the value or pressing enter creates a pill with the selected text value.
		Use the <code>ui:pillContainerAutoCompleteOption</code> component to provide an icon and text label for your predefined list of values.	See the Examples tab for more information.
