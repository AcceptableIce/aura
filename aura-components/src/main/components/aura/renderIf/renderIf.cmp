<aura:component support="GA"
    description="This component allows you to conditionally renders its contents. It will render its body only if isTrue evaluates to true. This has no effect on component creation, only on the actual rendering. The else attribute allows you to render an alternative when isTrue evaluates to false. The expression in isTrue is re-evaluated every time any value used in the expression changes. When the results of the expression change, it triggers a re-rendering of the component.">

<aura:attribute name="isTrue" type="Boolean" required="true" description="An expression that must evaluate to true to display the body of the component."/>
