        we gonna create this receiverCmp in test setUp, then in our test, receiverCmp will create a new cmp.
        then before the new cmp get back to receiverCmp, we  in-validate receiverCmp.
        This is what happens when people navigate to some page(like MyDay), create something (like a new Event),
        then navigate away from the page before the new Event page load.
